# Optimal Fixture Design using Expert-informed Reinforcement Learning
GitHub repository for the code in MATLAB and/or Python that is used to generate optimal fixture plans for aerostructure assembly using reinforcement learning.

## To-Do List
- Fix the neural network and alter the size of the paths
- Fix the reward policy that allocates more rewards
- See if a different algorithm performs better
